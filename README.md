# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Analyzing machine learning models with Python to predict credit risk.

## Overview

In this project sampling algorithims and supervised machine learning models were applied to credit card data to predict credit risk. Since credit risk is inherently unbalanced, resampling algorithms and machine learning models that reduce bias are used. After our models have been fitted and tested, a recommendation will be made on whether they should be used to predict credit risk. The dataset being used contains credit card stats from LendingClub in Q1 of 2019. Six different algorithms were used in the analysis.
